# Hide Discord Notices

This is a simple theme to hide the notices at the top of the Discord  

![Streamer Notice](img/streamer.png)
Yep. I know, I could tell.  

![Corrupt Installation Notice](img/corrupt.png)
Works fine 🤷  

To install, go to your powercord themes folder (`powercord/src/Powercord/themes/`) and run:  
`git clone https://github.com/diademiemi/Hide-Discord-Notices`  
Then restart your Discord client (CTRL + R)
